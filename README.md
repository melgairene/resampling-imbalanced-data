# resampling-imbalanced-data

In this repository we consider the following popular resampling techniques: oversampling, undersampling, Neighbour Cleaning Rule, Tomek Links and Synthetics minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The ensemble-resampling mixtures we considered are SMOTEBagging, and RUS Bagging. These techniques will be applied in combination with the following machine learning methods: knn, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees. 

These combinations are implemented in the file ProjectC680_Cancer on the imbalanced dataset available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer. 
This breast cancer domain was obtained from the Uni-versity Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana,Yugoslavia. Thanks go to M. Zwitter and M. Soklic forproviding the data.

In the file Generating_figures I provide a visualization on how these techniques affect a simple imbalanced dataset.
